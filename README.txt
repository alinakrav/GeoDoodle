WELCOME TO GEODOODLE!!!

To run this code, open the .pro file in QtCreator and hit the big green button in the bottom left.

Need to have OpenSSL installed for the code to work properly. Here is a link to a bunch of third-party binaries: https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries

Your Qt version must have the Web Engine and Network libraries installed, and the project must be compiled with MVSC 2017 or later (some machines may require the 32-bit version).

GUI should work equally well on all platforms.
